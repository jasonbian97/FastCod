subtitle: <p>FastCod can efficiently compute the diffusion-based connectivity feature between brain regions. It is a open-source tool and written in python. If you use diffusion-weighted MRI and tractography in your research or clinical practice, this tool can possibly save you lots of time!</p>

Key features:
* Over *30x speedup* than traditional method on computing connectivity
* Run from command line, server-friendly
* Easy to work with MRtrix3, fsl, and freesurfer
* Flexible pipeline design: you can flexibly run one, several, or whole pipline: dMRI preprocessing, tractography, align with anatomical images, computing connectivity
* Super-resolve ability: you can get high-res connectity features even if you are dealt with low resolution dMRI (e.g., 2mm$$^3$$)
* Multiple visualization tools for QA
